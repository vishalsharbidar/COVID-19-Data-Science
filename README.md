**Additional content material to UDEMY video lecture course**


[UDEMY course Link - Video Lecture](https://www.udemy.com/course/applied-data-science-covid-19-prototype/?referralCode=5316264CAD7289C935C9)

The goal of this lecture is to transport the best practices of data science from the industry while developing a COVID-19 analysis prototype

The student should learn the process of modeling (Python) and a methodology to approach a business problem.

The final result will be a dynamic dashboard - which can be updated by one click - of COVID-19 data with filtered and calculated data sets like the current Doubling Rate of confirmed cases

Techniques used are REST Services, Python Pandas, scikit-learn, Facebook Prophet, Plotly, Dash, + bonus section Tableau

For this, we will follow an industry-standard process (CRISP-DM) by focusing on the iterative nature of agile development

* Business understanding (what is our goal)
* Data Understanding (where do we get data and cleaning of data)
* Data Preparation (data transformation and visualization)
* Modeling (Statistics, Machine Learning, and SIR Simulations on COVID Data)
* Deployment (how to deliver results, dynamic dashboards in python and Tableau)

The entire lecture follows the development flow of a rapid prototype project.

Focus for the student is to develop its prototype, source code snipped are provided.
Topics and the corresponding programming (Python) are introduced step by step in a very compact way.
