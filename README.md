# Applied Data Science - COVID 19 Data Analysis

The goal of this project is to learn the best practices of data science from the industry while developing a COVID-19 analysis prototype

The project focuses on the process of modeling (Python) and a methodology to approach a business problem.

The final result will be a dynamic dashboard - which can be updated by one click - of COVID-19 data with filtered and calculated data sets like the current Doubling Rate of confirmed cases

Techniques used are REST Services, Python Pandas, scikit-learn, Facebook Prophet, Plotly, Dash, + bonus section Tableau

For this, I have followed an industry-standard process (CRISP-DM) by focusing on the iterative nature of agile development

* Business understanding (what is our goal)
* Data Understanding (where do we get data and cleaning of data)
* Data Preparation (data transformation and visualization)
* Modeling (Statistics, Machine Learning, and SIR Simulations on COVID Data)
* Deployment (how to deliver results, dynamic dashboards in python and Tableau)

The entire project follows the development flow of a rapid prototype project.

In final look, the dashboard is divided into 3 sections,

* Timelines confirmed, doubling rate
